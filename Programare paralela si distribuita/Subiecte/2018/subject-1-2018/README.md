# Exam to Parallel and Distributed Programming `feb 2018, subject no 1`

1. (3p) Write a parallel or distributed program that counts the number of permutations of `N` that satisfy a given property.
You have a function (`bool pred(vector <int> const& v)`) that
verifies if a given permutation satisfies the property.
Your program shall call that function once for each permutation
and count the number of times it returns true.

see: `permute_async.cpp`
